# QMC-code-1D-trapped-fermions

This C++ code performs variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo study of one dimensional trapped fermions. 
It calculates the ground state energy, pair and density distribution functions, one-body density matrix (using McMillan algorithm) 
and momentum distribution.
